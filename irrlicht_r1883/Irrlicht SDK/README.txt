The license of the Irrlicht Engine is based on the zlib/libpng license,
only the name and the authors name have been replaced. Even though this
license does not require you to mention that you are using the Irrlicht
Engine in your product, an acknowledgement would be highly appreciated.

Please note that the Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of the
Independent JPEG Group and the zlib. This means that if you use the
Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere in your
documentation that you've used the IJG code. It would also be nice to
mention that you use the Irrlicht Engine and the zlib. See the README
files in the jpeglib and the zlib for further informations.
